                        A Vue UI library called Vuetify features exquisitely designed Components that adhere to the Material Design guideline. John Leider and Heather Leider work full-time to create and manage Vuetify, an MIT-licensed project, with assistance from the entire Core Team.
                Vuetify is used to create user interfaces for web and mobile apps. Sponsors and volunteers from the Vue community have backed the initiative. You can ask JavaScript questions in the project's active Discord community forum, even if they have nothing to do with Vuetify. Through regular update cycles, the development team is devoted to addressing bugs and delivering improvements. Weekly fixes are also released to address problems reported by the community.
                Additionally, Vuetify offers pre-made layouts and free/premium themes that you may use to swiftly theme your application. The most recent version of Vuetify, which makes use of Material Design Spec v1, is v1.5.13 as of this writing. The Material Design Spec v2 will be used by Vuetify version 2.x when it becomes released. Let's move on to the following part to see a few methods for adding Vuetify to our projects.
